      <h2>My Journey at DTU</h2>
      <p>I’m currently a 1st-semester Computer Science and Engineering student at Delhi Technological University (DTU). My journey here has just begun, but it has already been full of learning, curiosity, and excitement. Stepping into DTU has given me a new perspective on how technology shapes our world and how coding forms the foundation of modern innovations. The environment here constantly motivates me to learn, explore, and grow both academically and personally.<br><br>

This semester, I started learning HTML and C programming, which are my first steps into the world of computer science. HTML has introduced me to the structure of web development—how websites are built, linked, and styled. I’ve enjoyed creating web pages using tags, headings, lists, and links, and later enhancing them with CSS to make them more attractive. On the other hand, learning C has helped me understand programming logic, syntax, and problem-solving. Although it was initially challenging, I gradually learned to use loops, conditions, and functions effectively.<br><br>

I also created small projects such as a Personal Portfolio Website, a Student Registration Form, and a Personal Blog Page, which allowed me to apply what I learned in a practical way. These projects not only improved my coding skills but also helped me become more confident with my ideas and creativity.<br><br>

Every day at DTU feels like a new opportunity to learn something valuable—whether it’s through lectures, peers, or self-practice. My goal is to strengthen my technical foundation, enhance my communication skills, and build a strong profile over the next four years. My journey at DTU has just begun, but I’m determined to make it meaningful, productive, and full of growth.</p>

      <h2>Learning Programming</h2>
      <img src="computer.jpg"  alt="Learning and Growth" class="learning-img">
      <p>I started learning HTML and C programming this semester as part of my Computer Science Engineering journey at Delhi Technological University. Entering this field has been an exciting and inspiring experience because it has allowed me to explore how technology works at the core level. HTML was the first programming language I learned, and it gave me a strong foundation in web development. I learned how to create simple yet structured web pages, use tags to format content, and connect different sections through links. Gradually, I began experimenting with styling using CSS, which helped me understand the importance of design, layout, and user experience. <br><br>

Alongside HTML, I have also been learning the C programming language. It has taught me how computers process logic, handle data, and execute instructions step by step. Although C seemed challenging at first, I now find it fascinating because it builds a strong base for understanding advanced languages like Java and Python in the future. Writing my first programs—such as printing patterns, performing arithmetic operations, and understanding loops—was a great learning experience.<br><br>

Throughout this semester, I have been improving my problem-solving and logical-thinking skills. Creating small projects like a personal website and a student registration form has allowed me to apply what I’ve learned in a practical way. I enjoy the process of writing code, debugging errors, and seeing the final output come to life on the screen. I look forward to learning more about programming, algorithms, and data structures in the coming semesters. This beginning with HTML and C has sparked my curiosity, strengthened my confidence, and made me more determined to grow as a future computer engineer.</p>
